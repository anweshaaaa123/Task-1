The dataset was thoroughly cleaned and preprocessed to ensure consistency and accuracy. Missing values were identified using the .isnull() function and appropriately handled by either removing the affected rows or imputing values where feasible. Duplicate records were eliminated using the .drop_duplicates() method to maintain data integrity. Text fields such as gender were standardized to lowercase and trimmed of whitespace to avoid inconsistencies. Column headers were renamed to a uniform format—lowercase with underscores instead of spaces—for better readability and compatibility. Data types were validated and corrected as needed; for example, age fields were converted to integers, and any date columns were parsed into a consistent dd-mm-yyyy format using pd.to_datetime(). The final cleaned dataset was saved as a CSV file and is now ready for analysis or modeling.
